# Farm Story session April 1st 2021

I had a normal session today that lasted over 10 minutes. I took my time with the collection process today, as I had a hard drive backup going.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Crops and collection

I did the usual full collection today and grew more red quinoa. I reached the max mastery level (4) of the crop today and earned 1 gem, a higher payout per crop, and a red Gnome.

## Revenue

The usual daily revenue was made today, minus 1 crop plot.
