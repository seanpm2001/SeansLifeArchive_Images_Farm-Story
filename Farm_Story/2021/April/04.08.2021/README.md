# Farm Story session April 8th 2021

I did my usual weekly collection today, and not much else.

## Crops

I am continuing to grow Red Quinoa (4 days) as it is the only crop I know of that doesn't cost gems, and doesn't expire after not playing for a week (I think it expires after 8 days)

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.
